         Think of an epoch like a single, complete run-through of all your data. If you're 
         learning to play a new song on the guitar, each epoch is like playing the song from 
         start to finish once. More epochs mean more practice, but too many might not make you 
         any better and just take up more of your time!

         In our neural network, a hidden layer is like a team of detectives trying to solve a 
         mystery. Each detective (neuron) is good at figuring out one part of the puzzle. The 
         hidden layer size is how many detectives you have on the team. More detectives might 
         solve the puzzle faster, but too many might just get in each other's way.

         Let's say you're watching a TV series to guess what happens in the next episode.

         your guess. Remembering more episodes might help you guess better, but it might also 
         confuse you with too much information.
